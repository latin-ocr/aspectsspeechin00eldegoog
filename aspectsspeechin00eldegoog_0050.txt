speaker in 1, 357 ; 1v, 19, 33; xn, 254, 5523 x111, 14, 468;
xlv, 602 is the indefinite τις or ἄλλος, but the verbal forms are
not iterative. In place of the Homeric εἴπεσκε, there occurs in

Quintus ἔειπεν (4), ἔκφατο μῦθον (2), φάτο μῦθον (l). The
familiar Homeric ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκεν and idcirc ἐς πλησίον ἄλλον
do not occur in Quintus. Neither are the forms cf conclusion
Homeris. Though provoked by the preceding context, this group
of speeches is otiose so far as contributing to the progress of the
action is concerned, except in 1, 212-19, which concluding with
an exhortation to light precipitates a battle. None of the collective
speeches in Quintus is given up to prayer. In xrv,117-9one
verse is prayer. For Homeric examples v. Γ 297 ff., 318 ff.;
H 177 ff, 200 ff.

With reference to structure Heinze has pointed out as charac-
teristic of the old epic speech its unlimited powers of extension,
especially in the admission of new epic material. When and
where the poet pleases he lets the speech become narrative. The
principle of concontration and of compression in Quintus is seen
in the fact that he has no speech of greater length than 50 verses,
while Apollonius only once rises to 97 verses Nonnus, however,
exhibits aretum to the extension of the older epic; ι. 9., xl,
356-4813 xxxvnr, roe-434.

In Apollonius and Quintus there is a noticeable curtailment
of reminiscence. The old men in the Posthomeriea talk less than
they do in Homer, though the latter is dramatically true when he
allows Nestor and Phoenix to talk on. The speech of Phoenix
to Achilles in l 434-605 contains 131 verses of digression in the
form of detailed reminiscence. The best example in the Argo-
nautica is the bit of reminiscente in Π, 775-91. That it was
quite consciously compressed may be gathered from the authoffs
own words, Ι, 1220: ἀλλὰ τὰ μὲν τηλοῦ κεν ἀποπλάγξειεν ἀοιδῆς.
Quintus cannot show more than 13 verses in one speech ; 111,
etv-79, where Phoenix laments over the body of Achilles 3 Iv,
eor-19, in the speech of Nestor to the Greeks

A comparative survey of the congeneric speeches in Quintus
does net show that any fixed forms were in the mind of the poet,
although Quintus frequently uses the seme material over again.
