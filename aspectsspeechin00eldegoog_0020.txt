Aapecta of rte Sperchio tlte luter Greek Epic. 13

τοίων τις μεσσηγὺς ἀνὰ πτερὰ κινήσασα
ὑψοῦ ἐπ’ ἀκρεμόνων Ἥρης ἠνίπαπε βουλάς·
“ Ἀκλειὴς ὅδε μάντις, ὃς οὐδ’ ὃσα παῖδες ἴσασιν
οἶδε νόῳ φράσσασθαι, ὁθούνεκεν οὔτε τι λαρὸν
οὔτ’ ε’ρατὸν κούρη κεν ἔπος προτιμυθήσαιτο
ἠιθέῳ, εὖτ’ ἄν σφιν ἐπήλυδες ἄλλοι ἕπωνται.
ἔρροις, ὦ κακόμαντι, κακοφραδές· οὔτε σε Κύπρις,
οὔτ’ ἀγανοὶ φιλέοντες ἐπιπνείουσιν Ἔρωτες.”
Ἴσκεν ἀτεμβομένη· μείδησε δὲ Μόψος ἀκούσας
ὀμφὴν οἰωνοῖο θεήλατον, ὧδε τ’ ἔειπεν·

Here Apollonius, the imitator of Homer, has apparently violated
Homeric precedent for τ 546-50 may not be cited asa comfort-
able illustration of speaking by birds, prophetie or not. The
personality of Odysseus is there blended with the eagle. The
solitariness of the exception in Apollonius leads one to examine

it in the hope to discover special warrant. The hope is confirmed
when one notices the evident care which Apollonius has taken to
give speeches to gods and men alone. For in Ν, 585-91 the
words of prophecy and command uttered by the oaken bearn of
the ship Argo are recorded indirectly in spite of its divine endow-
ment as αὐδῆεν. ἸἸιίς may fairly he construed to indicate a
reluctance on, the partos Apollonius to assign direct speech to the
non-personal—a reluctance better appreciated when it is noted
that the author of the Orphic'Argonautica introduces the same
oaken beam as speaking in the direct form, vv. 1164-74.
Apollonius felt the restrictions of the older epic; the author
of the Orphic Argonautica was less sensible of them.

The exceptional characteres the speech by a crow is hardly
warranted hythe fact that the divinatione of Mopsus were so
much a matter of omithoscopy as to have given rise to the tradi-
tion recorded hy Clemens Alexandrinus ¹: Δωρόθεός τε ἐν τῷ
