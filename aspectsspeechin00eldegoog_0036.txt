Honorio gods in the affairs of Homeric men-this he could not
. wradily appropriate in its fullest extent. Glover¹ may say of

lleage of Quintus that men had climbed from the vivid anthro-
pomorphism of Homer to conceptione of lostier and purer deity
. tl the Zeus and Athena of the poet were names outworn, but that
hspite of this there is scarcely a trace in Quintus that the world
lus moved since Homer sang. The story, however, of the speech

· inthe Posthomerica shows that even in the stronghold of epic
lens and Athena have lost power. In noticeable fashion have

· they and Hera reoeded from immediate participation in the events
of the Posthomerica.

Returning to the Odyssey, one may note that Athena, ZeuS,
Poseidon, Apollo and Ares have together 53 speeches, Ares and
Apollo appearing as speakers only once, and then in the hy of
Demodocus where their appearance has nothing to do with the
events of the poem. Hera, Aphrodite and Thetis do not spealr
in the Odyssey. Three of the speeches of Poseidon have no
bearing upon the action of the epic: θ 347-8 ; ass-6, and

’ λ ars-52, the first two falling within the lay of Demodocus.

In the Argonautica of Apollonius, Hera, Thetis, Athena and
Aphrodite speak collectively 17 times. A general statement
of value is made by A. (locat, La Poeaie Alexandriae, p. 306:
“On a deja heureusement fait remarquer le role efface que jouent
les divinitas dans les Argonautiques, et les transformatione qu'elles
ont subies d'Homere a Apollonius. A peine apparaissent-elles pt
et la pour mettre le drame en jeu et en preparer le denouement:

,’ Hira, Cypris et Athene qui dirigent l'action au lieu de Zeus ou
d'Apollon,” etc. It is noticeable that Zeus does not spealr at

”ll-² Apollo, Poseidon and Ares share the same fate. Ares
⁰f course is not much at home in the Argonautica. The fact that
there is no need for certain gods to appear in the different epics is
⁸ sufficient explanation os their failure to speak, but speaking by
Zeus in the Argonautica might reasonably be expected. Similarly
¹¹¹ the Orphic Argonautica there is a sorry showing made by the
