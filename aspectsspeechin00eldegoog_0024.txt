κορώνη. The possibility of such derivation would be enhanced
by the similarity in sound of the two words. This similarity,
whether or not there was such a folk etymology current in the
time of Apollonius, may have been regarded by him as a very
happy coincidence and have determined his choice of the word
κορώνη instead of κόραξ which is employed by Callimachus in the
hymn to Apollo. λακέρυζα is also an epithet of κορώνη, Hes. Op.
747, Ar. Av. ¹609. Aside from being suggestive of the native
city of Callimachus and ultimately of Callimachus himself, the
word κορώνη would seem to be suggestive too of a literary rival.
The Pindaric precedent, to be discussed subsequently, of referring
to rivale as crows may well have been in the mind of Apollonius.

The suggestion, therefore, hangs over the passage that the
λακέρυζαι κορῶναι in 111, 929 are the Περικαλλίμαχοι ; while
at the chief of the school, Callimachus, a thrust is made in v. 930,
τοίων τις μεσσηγὺς ἀνὰ πτερὰ κινήσασα. To test the suggestion
by attempting to follow it out into details and see a double
significance in the speech itself is demanding perhaps more than
the poet intended. It may not be demanded of polemio in the
higher ranges of poetry that it be conspicuously such. Still one
is tempted to see in the speech a reference to the literary exile
of Apollonius that followed tbe failure of the Argonautica at
Alexandria (ἀκλειὴς ὅδε μάντις . . . . ἔρροις), while in the smile of the
seer Mopsus is mirrored the later success of the poet (μείδησε δὲ
Μόψος ἀκούσας). That Apollonius intended Theocritus to be
numbered among the λακέρυζαι κορῶναι is suggested by a com-
parison of Apollonius, 111 927 and Theocritus vn 8-9.

Ap. Rh, ΙΙΙ 927 αἴιγειρος φύλλοισιν ἀπειρεσίοις κομόωσα

Theoc, VII 8-9 αἴγειροι κλῆθραί τε ἐύσκιον ἄλσος ἔφαινον
χλωροῖσιν πετάλοισι κατηρεφέες κομόωσαι.

Gercke felt some intimacy to exist between the two, and a
Theocritean baokground would not be out of place.

The use of the word crow as a designation of literary rivals
has precedent in Pindar. Jebbl observes: “Itis indisputable
