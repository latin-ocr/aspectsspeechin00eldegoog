the later Roman epio continued the habit of Vergil, doubtleualso
' inherited, in allowing the speech to begin within the verse.

Standing in contrast with this markedly fixed habitin Greek
epic is the fate of antilahae in Greek tragedy. Aeschylus with
one exception does not employ this form of stichomythia, therein
differing from Sophocles and Euripides.¹

Worthy of a passing note is the absence from Greek epia
speeches of the parenthetic verb of saying. It would not suit
the dignity of epio. Itis a nuisance in Plato.2 In the Sympo-
sium 1900 in a directly recorded speech of Zeus the parenthetic
ἔφη occurs. The instance in the epic idyl of Theocritus, XXVI,
19, where ἔειπε is used is a slight affair.

The Homeric practice of introducing speech within speech has
a curicus history in later epic and serves to illustrate how in
some points the Homeric model seems completely to have been
neglected. There are 49 speeches of various kinds occurring
within speeches in Homer.³ In the Odyssey the type of in·
cluded speech announeed hy such phrases as καί νύ τις ὧδ’ εἴπῃσιν

(ζ 275) and μήποτέ τις εἴπῃσιν (φ 324) is represented hy these
two cases alone, though frequently employed in the Iliad.
Apollonius has not a single instance of a speech within a
speech, although he has created opportunities for it in 1, 1338 and
1v,1352-6 where the words of the goddesses might have been
inserted in the direct form of IV, 1324-8. Among the epic

pisces of Theocritus there is one example, xxrr, 154-66, where
Lynkeus gives in the direct form a speech of his own on a
previous occasion. Quintus has onlya single instance of direct
