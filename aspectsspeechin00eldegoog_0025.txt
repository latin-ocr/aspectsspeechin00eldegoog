that several passages of Pindar express soom for some people
who are compared tpcrows or daws, to apes or foxes. The only
question is, are all such utterances merely general, referringto
classes of persons, such, for instance, as the vulgar herd of .
inferior poets? Or is the allusion in such places, or in any
of them, to individuals‘l'' For the dual of γαρύετον of the
passage to be cited immediately from Pindar, Jebb can see no
explanation except in the assumption that thereby two definite
persons are indicated. According to the Alexandrian commen·
tator, Simonides and Bacchylides are the persons. Apollonius,
therefore, had before him precedent in poetry for polemio directed
toward specific rivals which was appreciated as such by his
contemporaries.
In Pindar, Olym„ 11, 94-7, are these words:

σοφὸς ὁπολλὰ perdis φυᾷ

μαθόντες δὲ λάβροι

παγγλωοίρ, κόρακες ὥς, ἄκραντα γαρύετον
Διὸς πρὸς ὄρνιχα θεῖον.

translated thus by Jebb¹: “The bard is he whose mind is rich
by nature’s gift; men shaped by lore have sound and fury
effecting nought ; 'tis the chattering of orows against the godlike
bird of Zeus'' Verrall² suggests a reference to the two Sicilian
rhetoricians Korax and Tisias. In Nera„ 111, 80 ff., is another

on which Bury remarks: “These words like many others iu
Pindar are charged with a two-fuld meaning3 they refer appa·
