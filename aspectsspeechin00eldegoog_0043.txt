36 Aupecta of tbe speech ia tbe later Greek Epic.

message: ἐκ δ’ἄρα πᾶσαν l πέφραδε ἀγγελίην. One of the best
instances of repetition in substance in the Argonautica occurs in
1v,1347-62 where Jason reporting the words of the Ἠρᾷησαι,
vv. 1318-29, repeats one verse, 1323: 1358. The change of
pronoun in v. 1354 disturbs its perfect equation with v. 1328.

From a survey of these passages the conclusion seems a fair
one that Apollonius and Quintus are inclined to avoid what the
reader already lmows. This is what Heinze¹ has said of Vergil
in comparison with Homer. The repetition of blocks of verses
is a feature of the Homeric epic sufficiently prominent to have
been noticed and employed by any close imitator. Apollonius
and Quintus must have been conscious of this important aspect
of the Homeric manner and in failing to continue it show a
certain independence that connotes a criticism of the leisure of
the elder epio-a conclusion confirmed by the curtailment of remi-
niscence in their poems. In the matter of repetition and in that
of the speech within speech one cannot apply the words of Oouat ²:
“ Ge qui est certain, c'est que partout‚ dans ApoHonius, se laisse
voir le travail d'un imitateur zelo d'Homere.'’ Nor for Quintus
in these respecta can one accept the words of Sainte-Beuve3: “ Il
resulte de cette imitation computatae et comme filiole a laquelle
il s'est voue‚ qu'il est simple,'' etc. That the reluctance of
Quintus to repeat is to be attributed to the precedent of Vergil
cannot safely be affirmed. Perhaps Apollonius exercised some
influence. That Apollonius in eliminating repetition was reflect-
ing the critical literary feeling of his own time seems in a way to
meet with confirmation in the action of Zenodotus who arbitrarily
compressed B 60-70 into two verses The absence of repetition
in the later epic may be regarded as a slight factor in the decline
in amount of speech which marks the poems of Apollonius and
Quintus.

In still further pursuing the differences between the speeches
of Homer and his successors‚ one may consider the matter of the
monologue. The temptation to compare Homer and Quintus
