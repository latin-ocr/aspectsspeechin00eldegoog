sorrow that is ever uppermost in the mind 0f Andromache. For
no sooner bas she rebuked the Amazon for ber folly in aspiring to
do what the mightier Hector tried to do at the eost of his life
tban she turns to a recollection of the high regard paid to Hector
by the people, to give way again to thoughts of her own loss and
the sorrow that is in store for her all her days The beginning
of me monologue prepares for a crisis—the death of the Amazon
queen, but the close is an expression of personal feeling. The
same principle of association of ideas seems tc be at work here as
in the monologue of Achilles, Σ off} Again, the monologue
of Apollo, 111 57-9, prepares for a similar crisis—the death of
Achilles. The words of Thetis in Iliad, Ω 131-2, that death
stands near her son, the similar statements in 111 16-7‚ 44 of
the Posthomeriea culminate in the recognition by Apollo that
no one can now save Achilles, not even Zeus. The inevitableness
of the event is reflected in the brevity of the monologue and the
death of Achilles is, therefore, immediately expected. The fime-
tion of the monologue here is to precipitate action. Hentze bas
remarked an adaptation of the monologue in Homer tc each
situation and to the feelings of the speaker, citing T 424 ff. and
v199ff. The former is spoken by Achilles when he sees Hector
in battle for the first time and contains only three verses with two
'thoughts thrust out in passionate haste. But in v 199 ff., a
monologue of seventeen verses there is a long string of fears,
wishes, apprehensions which oppress the soul of Odysseus when
he thinks the Phaeacians have not brought him home. Of a
different character are the words a nymph utters to herself in

x,-471 6 of the Posthomerica. Her monologue marks the close

of the tunhappy episode of Paris and Oenone. It rs the judgment Ι
of a chorus passed upon Paris. ,- ”
In the Argonautica of Apollonius, Heinre² has noted that ffle
monologue 1s confined to¹ Medea: 111 464-70; 636-443 7 71-
8013 1v30-3. To these should be added the monologue of
Μήνη in 1v 57-65. The conception of the monologue as a kind
of dialogue between the speaker and his thoughts is not so clear
