depecta of the Speech ia tte later Greek Epic. 25

From this collection of examples which is thought to be
complete, it is seen that there is a marked increase in the use
of the vocative with ὦ ouer that in the Iliad. According to
Scott, l. α, ὦ is employed 73 times in the Iliad, while in 628
instanoes of the vocative the interjection is not employed. The
Posthomerica has 65 cases of the vocative with the interjection ὤ
and 78 cases without. Thus, in the Iliad one vocative in ten has
d 3 in the Posthomerica, one in two. In spite of this increase
Quintus shows a conspicuous respect for certain Homeric regula-
tions as to the use of the vocative with the interjection. The old
epic θεσμός excluded ὦ from prayers and speeches directed to the
gods. Seott attributes this exclusion to the familiar tone of ὦ,
believing that metrioal reasons cannot explain the non-occurrence
in Homeros such phrases as: ci Ζεῦ, ὦ θεοί, ὦ Κρονῶη, ὦ θύγατερ
Διός, ω’ Μοῦσαι, ὦ γαιήοχε κυανοχαῖτα, ὦ Θέμι, ὦ Φοῖβ’, ὦ Θέτι.

The prohibition against the use of the interjection with the
names of the gods is violated by Apollonius in two trivial instanoes
only IV 1411, 1414:

δαίμονες ὧ καλαὶ καὶ ἐύφρονες, iha‘r’, ἄνασσαι

ὧ νύμφαι, ἱερὸν γένος Ὠκεανοῖο

Quintus has no case in which individuale appealing or speaking to
the gods employ the vocative with ὦ. (lases of such appeal with-
out ὧ are as follows: Ζεῦ ΙΙΙ, 9; xlv, 119 3 Ζεῦ πάτερ 111, 4993
lx, 173 θεὰ μεγάθυμε (Athena) XII, 1533 πάτερ (Zeus) 1, 186;
Φοῖβε 111, 46, 98 ; in ΧΠ, 306 Μοῦσαι occurs without ὣ.

In the Iliad the interjection is never added to apatronymio
direotly. Several metrically possible combinations of ὦ with the
patronymic are set down by Scott. Apollonius does not use the
two together and the same restriction obtains in Quintus who uses
Πηλείδη in ΙΙΙ, 40, 493; Teleda IV, 89 ; Πριαμίδη VI, 309 ; IX,
248.

Soott finds that no woman uses the interjection ὧ in Homer.
This is not true of Apollonius: 1, 6573 111, 891. In the Post·
homerica there are three instances, two of which may be accounted
