4 Aspeots of tte Sperchio rte later· Greek Epic.

40 verses are concemed, Apollonius shows no real departure from
Homeris demands. Allowance must be made for the difference in
the length of the poems and for the relative frequency of speeches
in the two poets.¹

The shortest speech in Homer consists ofa single verse unless
it is possible to construe as such O 82: ἔνθ’ elavi) ἔνθα. Of
speeches limited to a single verse there are nine in the Iliad?
eleven in the Odyssey.3 There are no cases of snch speeches in
Apollonius. Only two or three would be expected. There is
one instance in Quintus, ΧΗ, 153. lt is in Nonnus that the
shortest· speech in Greek epic is found, xrn, 485 στῆθι, τάλαν.

The range of the percentages of speech for the books of the
different epic poems is amatter of some significance. Schneide-
win's tables show that the books of Homer range in percentage
of speech from 19 (ι) to 82 (I). The books of Apollonius range
from 20 (1) to 39 (111) 3 those of Quintus from 3 (151) to 45( ).
The books of Nonnus range from 3 (xr11)to 83 (xxxvnr). The
following tables do for the later epic poets what Schneidewin has
done for Homer. They give the books of the later cpio poems
arranged according to their percentages of speech.

lHomer has 33 speeches of more than 40 vv. The bulk of Apollonius is less
than l and more than ΙΙ, of that of Homer. Hence one would expect less than
8 and more than 6 such speeches‚ i. a, about 7 for Apollonius. But Apollonius
contains only 'la as' much speech as Homer (Homer 50 per cent. ; Apollonius
29 per cent), and therefore only ³(5 of 7 or 4 such speeches fall to the lot of
Apollonius. By considering the relative frequency of speech as given in lines
(1 for every 41 vv. in Apollonins; one lor every 21 vv. in Homer) the number
ol such speeches required ol Apollonius would be only 3l. The Argonautica has
four, 1, 793-833; 11, 311-4073 111, sao-663 1v‚ 783-832. And in the case of
Quintus, after making similar allowances‚ one would expect about four. The
Posthomerita in fact contains two, v, 181-236, 239-290. Nonnus has 48 speeches
which vary in length from 40 to 330 verses. The largest of these are narrative
speeches: 11, 356-4813 xxxvm, ros-4343 xn, 429-5733 xnv, 96-215, and
themselves contain long speeohes. The upper limit in length of speech for Homer
is 260 verses (ὃ 333-592) according to Schneidewin. Apollonius and Quintus lall
far short of this. The longest speech in the Argonautica is 97 verses (11, 311-
407) ; in the Posthomerica 56 verses (v, 181-236). The longest in the Iliadis
172 verses (Ι 434-605).
