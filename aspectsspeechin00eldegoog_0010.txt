verses in a total of 8786. Τ10 Orphic Argonautica which is
believed to have been written after the time of Quintus and
before Nonnus is 12 per cent. speech. Of its 1384 verace, 170
are occupied with speeches. A reaction shows itself in Nonnus
whose poem is 36 per cent. speech. Of 21279 verses comprising
the Dionysiaca 7611 010 given to speech. Tryphiodorus sinks
to 20 per cent, while Colluthus is capable of 37 per cent.
Taetzes in his wretched performances has but 84 verses of speech
in 1675 015 per cent.

From Homer to Tzetzes, Greek epic poetry shows 0 steady
decline in the number 01 speeches if we leave out 01 Ι110 account
the Orphic Argonautica in which speeches are rarer. than in
Nonnus, and Colluthus who returns almost to the frequency of
the Iliad. The decline may be indicated in the following way:

Homer employs 1311 speeches,l or one for every 21 verses of his -

poems. Apollonius has 143 speeches, or one speech for every
41 verses. The number 01 speeches in Quintus is 176-0110101
every 50 101000. Homeric frequency would demand 01 Quintus
about 418 speeches. Had Quintus observed the frequency in the
Iliad we should have had 382 speeches. The Orphic Argonautica
has 14 speeches, or one 101 every 96 verses. The Dionysiaca
contains 305 speeches, or one for every 70 verses.2 Tryphiodorus
has 8 speeches, or one for every 86 verses. The nearest approach
to Homer is found in the little episode of Colluthus where 16
speeches occur, one 101 every 25 verses. Tnetzeshas 14, orons
for every 105 verses.

Schneidewin has pointed out that 33 01 110 speeches 01 Homer
consist 01 40 01 more verses. But the limit is purely arbitrary
and leads to wrong conclusicns. The average length 01 110 epio
speech increases in Apollonius (118811), Quintus (11.78 vv.)
and Nonnus (24.9511.) as compared with Homer (105711),
and this would indicate that the later epic poets preferred slightly
longer speeches than Homer. Yet as far as speeches of more than
