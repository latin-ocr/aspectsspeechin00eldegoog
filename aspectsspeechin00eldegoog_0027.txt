speech of the crow with personality and thereby modifies its
exceptional character. Whether this bit of polemio is unbecoming
epic is another matter. Jebb1, in alluding to the reluctauce of
moderna to believe that a great poet like Pindar could have dealt
in such innuendo as above instanced, has remarked happily: “It
is hardly needful to say that modern standards of feeling cannot
safely be applied to an ageos which the tone in such matters was
so different.''

In the Posthomerioa all speakers are either divinities or
persons. Like Apollonius, Nonnus has a speech by a crow, 111,
103-22. In both cases the crows flap their wings. Again‚ in
the Dionysiaca the direct utteranoe of dogs and of a hill is
recorded in v. 459-60 and 462-6 within the speech by the shade
cfAktaeon. The λίθος of Niobe speaks in xiv, 274-82. Oaktrees
speak a verse and a half in xv, 389-90. The lament which the
oow seems to utter in xv, 398-418 is another instance. Objeotion
may be urged against it on the ground of the introductory words,
v. 397, ἔοικε δὲ τοῦτο βοῆσαι, but the passage is speech in effect.
In xvl, 290, ἄμπελος gives forth an Ὑμὴν Ὑμέναιε, aud in the

following verse ὀρεσπιὰς πεύκη ories ἱμερόεις γάμος οὗτος where
the postposition of the verb of saying deserves a passing notice.
In xx, 137-41 are the words of πίθος, speech in effect but intro-
duced by vv. 135-62

καὶ εἰ βροτέην λάχε φωνήν,

τοῖον ἔπος Σοπύροισιν ἐρεύγετο κῶμον ἀκούων.

Ambrosia, who had been changed into a φυτόν and made αὐδῆεν
by Rhea, speaks in xxa 36-52. In xxxvn1,333-46 ἀστήρ
becomes excited at the reckless driving of Phaethon and bids him
spare his whip. From a survey of these passages, the conclusion
is formed that N onnus had a debased feeling for the epio speech.
He has not observed the Homeris limitations as to speakers.
Equally interesting is a comparison of the epic poets with
reference to the objecta spoken to. Speeches in the Iliad
addressed to other than divinities and persons are confined to
