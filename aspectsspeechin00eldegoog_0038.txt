der noch mangelhasten Ausbildung der Syntax, da die Formen
der erzihlten Rede noch nicht so allseitig entwickelt oder doch
noch nicht so geliufig waren dass grissere Gedankenreihen sich
damonae Schwierigkeiten wiedergeben liessen. Was aber ur-
springlich nur ein Nothbehelf war wurde bei weiterer Entwick- ,
lung der epischen Kunst zu einem besonderen Kunstmittel ausge-
. bildet, welches in hervorragender Weise dem Zweck cliente, das

Vorgangene lebhatt zu vergegenwartigen, und daber auch in allen
andern Arten der Rede angewendet.'' Doubtless the complexities
of oratio obliqua are late, butte find in their late coming the
ultimate cause for the employment of oratio recta first in
monologue and afterwards in all other forms of discourse in epie
istc disregard the fact that from the start there must have been as
an inevitable concomitant of ῥῆσις a certain conspicuous charm cf
directness. This must have been the overwhelming consideration
that determined its use, that would have determined the choice of
it, had the syntax been completely developed. The early epic
poet had no reason to regret the absence of syntectical means
which, had he employed them, would have denied him the very
⁷ effect he desired, namely, πρὸ ὀμμάτων ποιεῖν.

Further evidence for the innate preference of the Greek for the
direct form cf expression may be adduced from his reluctance—
rather his inability to get away from oratio recta in developing
the obliqua. The Greek did not think the oratio obliqua as did
the Roman, but had the oratio reeta in mind. The experience
of the Greek negative affords a clew. For oratio recta has
intruded its negative ot into the company of the infinitive in
oratio obliqua-an intrusion resented in conspicuous manner
in Homer. The closeness of oratio obliqua to oratio recta in
Greek made this transfer possible.

As examples in Homer of speech materials within speech one
may cite Γ 88, Θ 415, Ι 680, where the indirect discourse is
concluded by ὣς ἔφατ’-μ practice recurring in Apollonius, 1v 236,
592,1121‚ but not as in Homer within a speech. Scin Odyssey,
a 42, ὣς ἔφαθ’ Ἑρμείας concludes an indirect record within a
speech. See also θ 570, ρ143-6, where, after φῆ, the oratio
obliqua posses into oratio recta in ἥ μιν ἀνάγκῃ ἴσχει, and
