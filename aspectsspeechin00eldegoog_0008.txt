hSPECTS OF THE SPEECH ΙΝ THE LATER
GREEK EPlC.

The life and vigor of the poems of Homer has among its
constituents the important element of speech.l The extent of its
employment has been measured and the statistics show that just
one-half of Homeris composed of the directly recorded utterances
of his charactere. The speech, therefore, with its varied aspecta,
promises to be of significance as a chapter of comparative study
in Greek epic poetry. Its subsequent fate may fairly be expected
to throw no little light upon the relations of the later epio poets
to the source of their inspiration, upon the extent of their adher-
euce toand departure from Homeric standards. Particularly is
this so in the case of Quintus of Smyrna, for the reader readily
recognizes that the immediate purpose of the Posthomerica is to
fill in the gap between the pcems of Homer, although the poem
of Quintus looks bachward to the Iliad rather than forward to
the Odyssey. The feeling that Quintus regarded himself as more
thau a mere imitator of Homer and aspired to some independence
as an epic poet is perfectly compatible in view of his obvious
purpose, with an exacting comparison of the Iliad and the Post-
homerica. We shall find departures more serious thau the un-
Homeric designation of the dog of Hades as Κέρβερος (VI, 254)
and the absence of the favoritc Homerio epithet of Nestor Γερήνιος
ἱππότα. We shall find coincidences as interesting as the hostility
of the poets to the word λόγος.2

¹v. Plato, ch, 393 Β.
2Α. Nauck, Meleager Gracc-Rectam, 11 (1863), 378, note, finds that λόγος
occurs but once in Quintus, 111, 499 :

Ζεῦ πάτερ, ἢ ῥά τι καὶ σὺ βροτοὺς ψευδέσσι λόγοισι
θέλγεις,

The practical non-occurrence of the word in Homer is well known. Ol the two ¹

examplcs, that in aot:
