2 Asparata of the Spccch ιἰι the later Greek Epic

Between Homer and the epic poets Apollonius and N onnus ί
such intimacy of theme does not exist, but a departmental interest
attaches to their speeches. The two Argonauticas are naturally
compared. The epic bits of Tryphiodorus and ColluthuS, and
Tzetzes are not worthy of much attention. So large a field of
investigaticn as the comparative study of the epic speech, involv-
ing as it does a multitude of matters, is not immediately ιο be
exhausted. In the following pages Apollonius and Quintus have
received the more immediate consideration, but even in these,
little other than externals has been treated.

Later Greek epic poetry never returns to the amount of speech
that is found in Homer. M. Schneidewinl records the fact that
50 per cent. of Homer is speech—44 per cent. of the Iliad and
56 per cent. of the Odyssey. In the 27713 verses of the Homeric
poems, 13869 are speech. Of the Argonautica of Apollonius

29 per cent. is speech or 1699 verses out of a total 5832.
Quintus in the Posthomerica has 24 per cent. speech or 2073)

αίεὶ δὲ μαλακοῖσι καί αἱμυλίοισι λὶγοισι
θέλγει,

so closely resembles the single case in Quintus as ιο be regarded the source of it.
The use of the phrase αἱμυλίοισι λὶγοισι in Hesiod (Th. 890), Homeric Hymn
ιο Hermes (317), Theognis (704) and Apollonius (111, 1141) leads one ιο be-
lieve that it is a bit of Homeric phraseology which became the occasional property
of epic poets. Wellauer (1828) on Apollonius, 111, 1141, has the following
note: “Hoc uno loco Apollonius vocabulo λὶγος usus est, raro omnino apud
epicos poetas et ita ut Homeri et Hesiodi auctoritatem sequeretur qui αἱμυλίοισι
λόγοισι dixerunt Od., 1, 56, Theog. 889.” λόγος is absent from the Orphic Ar-
gonautica and is not ιο be found in Nonnus who collects a few of his terme for
“word” in m1,480-4. For αἱμυλίοισι λόγοισι θέλγει an equivalent is found in
κλεψιυόοις δ’ ὀάροισι παρήπαφεν, XL, 7. Weinberger’ s index verborum for Colluthus
and Tryphiodorus shows the absence of λόγος from their epic pisces. The repug-
,“ nance of epic ιο the word is doubtless an expression of the mutually repellent
character of Logos and Mythcs. “When chos comes in Mythos retreats.
There is no λόγος in Homer, and the first prose writers were the first criticsf'
(B. L. Gildersleeve in preface (x) to Cary's translation, rte Historias os Herodotus,
New York, 1901).
