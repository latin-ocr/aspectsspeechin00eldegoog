Aspecta of the Speech in the later Greek hlpic 21

horsea and rivers-the latter forming no exception at all. In
Θ 185 Hector speaks to his horses as does Antilochus in Ψ 403.
One may note in the Odyssey the speech of Polyphemus to the
ram, ι 447. The comment on this passage in Ameis-Hentze
(Anhang) is suggestive: “ In solchen Stimmungen scheint der Lieb-
lingsgegenstand momentan von Geist beseelt mit dem Mensohen
zu sympathisieren. Wie hier Polyphemus mit seinem Leitbock
redet, so anderwarts ein Held mit seinen Rossen. . . . '' The
speech of Odysseus in ν 18-21 to his κραδίη stands on the same
plane with those speeches frequently introduced by εἶπε πρὸς ὃν
μεγαλήτορα θυμόν.

The speeches in Apollonius and Quintus are spoken to divini-
ties and persons. In v, 441-8 of the Posthomerica, Aias in
his madness speaks to a slain ram, but as he supposes it to be
Odysseus his speech may not be cited as an exception. In this
regard as in theone just mentioned Nonnus takes liberties. He
has his characters address κωφὸν ὕδωρ, ῥηγμῖνες ἀνανδέες, Ι, 128 ff. 3
βροντή, VIII, 270 ff.; ταῦρος, ΧΙ, 197 ff.; κύων, XVI, 191 ff. In
11, 258 ff. Typhoe makes an appeal to the might of his arms ¹:
χεῖρες ἐμαί, Διὸς οἷκον ἀράξατε. Worthy of a passing note is the
speech of Orontes in xxm, 65-9:

¹ γαστήρ, δέχνυσο τοῦτο φίλον ξίφος· αἰδέομαι ιγάρ,
μή τις ἐμὲ κτείνειεν ἀνάρσιος ἀπτόλεμος χείρ.
αὐτὸς ε’μῷ κενεῶνι θελήμονα χαλκὸν ἐλάσσω,
μή με πατὴρ μέμψαιτο δεδονπάτα θήλεῑ θύρσῳ,
μὴ Σάτυρον, μὴ Βάκχον ἐμὸν καλέσειε φονῆα.

This speech gives one sufficient warrant for believing that if
Nonnus had written the Posthomerica he would have had Aias
the suicide, in v, 483 ffi, deliver a speech to αὐχήν before
it received the Ἑκτόρεον ξίφος. The presence of a speech in the
one case and the absence of one in ’ the other is a note on
the different conceptione of the two poets as to the proper objects

to be addressed in epic speeches. The speeches of Tryphiodorns
