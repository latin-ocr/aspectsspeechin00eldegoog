11, 288, but not in her capacity as messenger. In correlated
speeches Quintus is found to repfflt only a single verse, 1v 94 =
104. Neoptolemus gives the substance of his fathers command
to the Argives 3 he does not repeat the words of it.

Exact repetition in correlated speeches in Apollonius is con-
fined to one verse, owing partly to the sailure of the poet to
introduce speech within speech. Very few are the instances in
which Apollonius repeats even the substance of a command 101
he is generally s'atisfied with the bare announcement that a
command was delivered and that one of the company reported
to his fellows words intended for all. To take up some of the
passages in illustration. The command of Hypsipyle to Iphinoe
in 1, voa-707 is repeated in substance by Iphinoe to the Minyae,
vv, 712-6. The restrictione of oratio obliqua have prevented
exact repetition. But in 1, 847 the reader is told that Hypsipyle' s
long speech, 1, 793-833, to lason was repeated to his company,
but there is no speech by J ason—only πάντα διηνεκέως ἀγόρευσεν.
The words of Mopsus to Jason, 1, losa-1102, are reported by
Iason to the company in v. 1100 without speech. In 111, 495-
500 Iason reports in part the words of Aeetes, vv. 401-21,
practically repeating v. 410 in 490. In 111,1165 Jason in-
forms his companions of his conversation with Medea, buthe
does not speak in the direct form—wedavoao‘aevos τὰ ἕκαστα.
Hera gives certain commands to Iris in rv, 757-69. They are
delivered to Thetis, Hephaestus and Aeolus. This one learns
from the simple announcement that the bidding of Hera was
fulfilled, vv. 773-9. So again in 1v, 783-832 Hera in the course
of her speech gives Thetis certain commands. Iu v. 845 the
reader is informed that these commands were conveyed by Thetis
to the Nereide. Instead 01 ῥῆσις embodying either the words
or the substance 01 Hera's bidding one reads: Θέτις δ’ἀγόρευεν
ἐφετμὰς ΙἭρης. In 1v, 881 in place 01 any reiteration of the
command of Thetis in a speech, we read that Peleus spoke to
his companions the whole 01 it. Arete in IV, 1115-20 gives a
message 101 Jason which the poet puts in the indirect form. The
messenger finds Jason, but his words are' not recorded. The
reader learns in v. 1125 that the messenger delivered the whole
