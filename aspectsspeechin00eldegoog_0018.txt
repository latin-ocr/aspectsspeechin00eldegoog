discourse within a speech and this does not admit of comparison
with the Homeric types cited above. It is a shift from the
indirect to the direct form of discourse. In XII, 25-45, Odysseus
bids the Argives build a horse, conceal several of their number

within it and depart for Tenedos, leaving some one behind
(vv. 35-8):

dores ὑποκρίναιτο βίην ὑπέροπλον Ἀχαιῶν
ῥέξαι ὑπὲρ νόστοιο λιλαιομένων μέγ’ ἀλύξαι
ἵππῳ ὑποπτήξας εὐεργέι · “ τὸν δ’ ἐκάμοντο
Παλλάδι χωομένῃ Τρώιον ὕπερ αἰχμητάων.”

The absence of such speeches receives little explanation from the ι
fact that Quintus shares the later epic reluctance to repeat, pre-

ferring the less effective means of oratio obliqua ; e. 9, XIV,

235-45, after XIV, 185-2223 cf. Homer, β 96-102, τ 141-7,
ω 131-7; δ 333-50, ρ 124-41. For some reason Quintus like
Apollonius and unlike Nonnus failed to inherit the Homeric habit
of introducing brief speeches within speeches with such phrases
as καί ποτέ τις εἴπῃσιν, etc. Strangely enough in Nonnus there
is a return to the use of these short speeches, and 35 cases are to
be gathered from the Dionysiaca, 22 consisting of a single verse
or less. The impression, however, which they produce in Nonnus
is one of monotony. They are too frequently employed. One
finds ὄφρα τις εἴπῃ in 11, 303; v111, 2493 Xv, 284, 345; XXI,
39; XXX, 1843 XXXIII, 2613 XLVI, 1743 XLVIII, 548. Other
forms of introduction are ὅταν. . . τις ἐνίψῃ, VIII, 89 ; ὅπως . . .
βοήσω, XI, 29; καί τις ἐνίψῃ, XXXIX, 1423 μή τις ἐνίψῃ, XL,
1553 βοήσατε, XLVIII, 5593 εἴπατε, XLVIII, 802. A form that
is happily without the sanction of Homer is ἀλλ’ ἐρέεις : XL, 25,
545 ; XLV, 92, 1703 XLVII, 433. The monotony of the direct
discourse aster these forms is aggravated by their use also with
the indirect expression: ἀλλ’ ἐρέεις ὅτι, IV, 1883 VI, 3563 XLV,
82, and ὄφρα τις εἴπῃ. . . ὅτις XX, 316; XLVIII, 26, and ὅταν. .. ¹
τις ἐνίψῃ ὅττι, XX, 366. Rarely in Homer isthe indirect form
employed as in τ 121, ψ 135. Tryphiodorus has no examples
of such speeches There is an instance in Colluthus of Ι the direct

form introduced by εἴπατε in vv. 385-6. Λ
