women 1111,409,1111111ὧ φίλοι. The women in both cases ³4³

deeds that belong to men. Note vv. 414 ff. ’11161166 111 her rejly

“ 01 the 73 68668 61 ὣ with the vocative in the Iliad, φίλοι,1
word of familiarity, is used 21 timeS, and πέπον, a word 61 fami·
liarity or impatience, is used nine times'' (Scott, l. 6.). Ι11 ίῑῙῚθ
Posthomerica, out of 65 cases, 1611118Δ 61 φίλος-161 the most part
φίλοι-8166166161611211111166. πάτον does not occur with th⁰
interjection, nor in address in Quintus.

As in the Iliad, so in the Posthomerica, the interjection and
accompanying vocative stand with few exceptione at the beginning
61 the verse, and prevailingly as the first words of the speech·
In A 158, Δ 189, Ζ 164, Κ 43, 544, Π 422, Φ 394, Ψ 19, 179
the combination falls within the verse. When ὧ φίλοι and ὦ γέρον
occur they are regularly the opening words 61 the speech. The
tendency to place the interjection at the head 61 the verse is not,
however, in evidence an Apollonius: 11288, 111936‚1v1031, 1383,
1411. Itis to be remembered that the interjection is sparingly
used in the Argonautica. In the Posthomerica with five excep-
tions the interjection and vocative head the verse. The exceptione
are 11268,1428,111642,701,11111 155. In Apollonius the
vocatives 61 φίλος with ni, excepting rv 1741, stand at the begin-
ning 61 the speech. Quintus places them without exception at the
head 61 the verse. They are placed at the beginning 61 the second
verse in vn, 39,690811(11111, 52. Unknown to Quintus are such
combinatione as φίλος ὦ Μενελαε Δ 189, διοτρεφὲς ὦ Μενέλαε
Κ 43 and ὦ πέπον, ὦ Μενέλαε Ζ 55, P 238. Apollonius hasa
6886 61 the former in 1v 1411: δαίμονες ὥ καλοὶ καὶ ἐύφρονες.

To sum up the larger aspeots of the vocative in Quintus, one
finds curicus coincidences between the usage in the Iliad and in
the Posthomerica. The material 161 the coincidences is not very
