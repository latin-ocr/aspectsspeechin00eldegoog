depecta ostiu Speech ιἰι the later Greek Epic. 33

in the Iliad, B 23-33 = B 60-70, where Agamemnon repeats to
the elders the exact words that Ὄνειρος had spoken to him; and
the following in the Odyssey: β 96-102 = τ 141-7 = ω 131-73
8333-50 = ρ 124-141; π 288-94 = τ 7-13. Parallels to this
phenomenon are not forthcoming in the later epic. Of repetition
begun in oratio obliqua, but shifting tc oratio recta and thereby
involving the exact recurrence of some verses, and of repetition
incurred in other ways—of this there is a considerable amount in
the Iliad and Odyssey. Leaf ¹ says that the frequent repetition
of messages shows what the epic poet liked, though objecting to
the third repetition in B 60 ff. as too much. An excellent case of
repetition is I 122-57=1 264-299. If the single recurrence
of blocks of verses is abhorred by the later epic poets, still more
. impossible would be the double repetition found in B 11-15 =
28-32 = (io-9 ; Bas-102 = τ 141-7 -- ω131-7.

An interesting comment on the difference in feeling toward
repetition between Homer and Quintus may be drawn from the
statistics of Schmidt² and the observation of Paschal.³ Schmidt
finds that there are 1804 verses in Homer, which together recur
4730 times, and that if slight differences be overlooked there are
2118 verses which appear together 5612 times. In striking
contrast to this abundancc is the poverty of Quintus, from whose
Posthomerica Paschal has gathered together a scanty collection
cf five verses which recur every one once. A few more may be
added to his list: 11, 390 = 111, 435 3 111, aso-6 = v, 538-9;
lv, 94 = rv, 104 ; v, 603 = vr, 21 ; vr, 59 = xrv, 235. The
verse hs φάμενον προσέειπεν Ἀχιλλέος ὄβριμος υἱός is found in
VII, 219, 7003 V111,146; ΧΠ, 66; x111, 237 . This conspicuous
avoidance of repeated verses may fairly be construed as an indi-
cation that in congeneric ῥήσεις, coincidences are the unconscicus
but natural result of recurring situations 3 ο. y„ 111, 465-ss =
v, 538-9. Apollonius would not show up so well in the matter
of repetition.

Taking up the Posthomerica in detail one may note an oppor-
