one learns from Suidas¹ that Apollonius was the object of a
severe attach under the name of Ibis: Ἰβις· ἔστι δὲ ποίημα
ἐπιτετηδευμένον εἰς ἁσώώειαν καὶ λοιδορίαν εἴς τινα Ἶβιν γενόμενον
ἐχθρὸν τοῦ Καλλιμάχου. ἦν δὲ οὗτος ὁ Ἀπολλώνιος ὁ γράψας τὰ
Ἀρηοναυτικώ With this in mind one may proceed to the signifi-
cance of the name Ibis which has been compactly set forth by
Ellis²z “Nam Apollonius quamquam plerumque et in utraque
vita Alexandrinus vocatur, Athenaeo teste 283 ab aliis Naucratites
habitus est. At in Naucrati‚ quod erat oppidum Aegypti non
longe distans Alexandria ab oriente fuisse olim deum quendam
antiquum Theuth nomine cui sacra avis Ibis dicata fuerit, oon-
firmat Plato in Phaedro 27 4 C: unde N eucratica potissimum avis
et Apollonii civis Ibis fuit. Hinc praecipue rivale nomen Ibidis
imposuisse Callimachum reor 3 nec dubito ut volucrem, sic Mercu-
rium sive Theuth, cui ea sacra firit, partes in diris eius habuisse.''

Now it is tentatively suggested that the speech bya crow in
the Argonautica is to be associated with the savage attach upon
Apollonius by Callimachus in his poem the Ibis. A speech by
Ibis in the poem of Callimachus would give considerable signifi-
cance to a speech by a orow in the Argonautica for just as
Callimachus chose the bird name ibis ιο designate Apollonius, so
the latter employed κορώνη ιο indicate his rival because κορώνη
would as readily suggest Κυρήνη whence Callimachus came.
κορώνη is the bird sacred to Apollo and is called the child of
Apollo in Athen. 8, p. 359 e.³ Apollo is the founder and god
par excellence of Cyrene. The fourth and fifth Pythian odes of
Pindar show this. There was afamous oracle of Apollo at Cyrene
which was really the making of the city (v. Pindar, Pyra, IV,
53). The port of Cyrene was called Apollonia. But the allu-
sions to Cyrene and its founding by Apollo which Callimachus
makes in his hymn ιο Apollo are of far greater import for us.
They give additional point ιο the veiled reference to Callimachus
