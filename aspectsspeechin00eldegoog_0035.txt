Finally, in Nonnus Dionysus is capable 01 55 speeches, whil
Zeus trails far behind with 13.

But 01 greater import is the rdle of the gods as speakers inspic
The speaking done hy them in the Iliad is considerable. Inal
185 speeches are given them out of 675-27 per cent. Thenun·
ber in the Odyssey is 78, or 12 per cent. In the Argonautica 21
speeches are delivered by divinities, or 15 per cent. In Quintus
comes a decline to 10 per cent, and a noteworthy decline when it
is remembered that the Posthomerioa is to be compared with the
Iliad. It is a continuation 01 the Iliad rather than an anticipatiou
01 the Odyssey. The gods in Quintus, especially the more impor-
tant 0nes of the pantheon, suffer heavily. For in the Iliad 150
speeches are spoken by Zeus, Hera, Athena, Apollo, Poseidon,
Thetis, Aphrodite and Ares, while in the Posthomerioa the 111
six 01 these divinities speak 12 01 the 16 speeches put into 1111
mouths 01 the gods. Aphrodite and Ares 010 without speech'll

Posthomerioa. The θεομαχία in the Iliad yields a few speecl

There isan explanation 101 this decline. Homerio as Quint
sought to be, he could not withdraw himself from the atmosphe
