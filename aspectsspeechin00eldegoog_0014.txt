Aspectr of the Speos iu tha luter Greek Epic. ‘l

Among the departmental habits of Greek epic poetry is the
marked reluctance 10 hegin or end a speech within a verse. Of
the 1311 speeches in Homer only one begins within a verse,
Ψ 855 ff. Κο10010,1 unless he rejects this passage as an interpola-
tion ought 10 qualify his statement: “Unter den nahheichen
Reden der Ilias und Odyssea findet sich keine einzige deren
Anfang nicht mit dem Versanfang zusammenfiele.” But some·
thing is 10 be said against this single exception. It is not
formally introduced like >the rest 01 the speeches of Homer
(excepting Δ 303). 110012 objects 10 the passage containingythe
speech in the following terms: “With 798 we begin a long
addition absolutely devoid 01 any poetical merit and standing in
the harshest contrast with its surroundings. The three 00010010
contained in 798-883 rival each other in absurdity and obscurity.’'
See also Leaf's note 00 Δ 303. It therefore does not seem safe 10
urge Ψ 85511. as an instance of an Homeric speech beginning
within the verse. There is the same disinclination in Homer 10
begin or end a speech within 0 verse in the case of those speeches
which occur within others. In 49 10010οο00 01 such, only one
begins within a verse. Itis Z 479.

Apollonius is rigidly true to this Greek epic habit, in every
instance beginning his speeches at the beginning and ending them
at the close of averse. His contemporary Theocritus in the
epia pieces found himself similarly restricted, affording only a
single exception in Idyl, XXIV, 07. And yet Callimachus did not
hesitate 10 begin and enda speech within 1110 verse, e. 9., the
speech of Zeus 10 Artemis in the Hymn to Artemis, vv. 29-39.
Of. 0100 Eis Δῆλον 150, 162, 212; Εἰς Δήμητρα 42. The
Orphic Argonautica does not offer 00 exception. Quintus shows
the force of the tradition but slips in four instances, one case
being within a speech, ΧΠ, 37-8. One is tempted to think that
Quintus was inveigled into· these slips by the single case in
Homer cited above. For, as Koechly notes on Posthomerica, IV,
408, Quintus undoubtedly had the Homeric description of the
