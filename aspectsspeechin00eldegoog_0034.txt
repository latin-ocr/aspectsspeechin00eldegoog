s abundas Τ110 interjection is absent from prayers and addresses
2²⁵ 10 the gods. It is denied women regularly and in two cases where
ἱ women employ it, the ὦ connotes masculine character. The inter-
' jection is not found with patronymica Itis perhaps precarious
' 1ο affirm any marked appreciation by Quintus 01 the Homeric cir-
cumstances of the interjection; it seems equally precarious to cite
Quintus in illustration of any change 01 feeling for ὦ that came
² about in later times.

³ Remarkable in Nonnus is the slight use 01 the interjection dwith
the vocative. The 17 cases are as follows: ὦπάτερ v, 415, v11,
73, m, 663 ὦγύναι v111, 357, x1x‚ 423 ὦ Φρύγιε Ζεῦ x, 2923
ὦ τέκος xvrn, 316, xxxvn‚ 192, xxvan, 196 ; xmv, 191,

The next point for consideration is the distribution 01 the
speeches in the epic poeta. It is a natural and fair inference that
the hero in epic as the conspicuous center 01 11ιο performance
should speak more frequently than any 01 the other characters
The ,inference would hardly merit the verification 01 an actual
count if Achilles in the Iliad and Neoptolemus in the Posthomerica
were not altogether absent from long stretches 01 the poems. In
spite of this fact the supposition continues true from Homer to

Nonnus. Achillesin the Iliad is found to speak 86 times, greatly -

exceeding the number of speeches for Hector, who comes next in
order 01 frequency with 48. In the Odyssey‚ Odysseus naturally
1⁸ expected 10 run far abead 01 011 other characters. The number
ofspeeohes assigned him is 164 out 01 01010101 636 speeches in
tlltpoem. Telemachus follows with 82. Passing from Homer to
Apollonius one finds that J ason is assigned 32 speeches and Medea
17· The preponderance, however, seems to be offset by the passive
trucemve character 01 J ason, and the feeling arises that Apollo-
11lllshas unconsciously thrust him into a position of secondary
importasse and made Medea the larger center 01 interest.
Sinrilarly in the Posthomerica, Neoptolemus though not ap-
lating until the poem has reached its middle point, is given the
gratast number 01 speeches-19. Nestor stands next with 14.
