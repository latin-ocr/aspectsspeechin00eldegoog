immediately leads one to violate the chronological order in the
discussion. G. Hentzel records all the instances of monologue in
Homer. There are 21, 11 in the Iliad and 10 in the Odyssey.
Quintus has five monologues as follows: 1, 100-14 (Andromache),
111, 57-9 (Apollo); v, 465-81 (Aias); Χ, 424-31 (Oenone); Χ,
471-6 (nymph). The lament in general, especially that of
Thetis, 111, 608-30, in which no address is made to the dead
AchilleS, may be regarded as a close approximaticn to the mono·
logue. The Homeric formula frequently used to introduce the
monologue, ὀχθήσας δ’ἄρα εἷπε πρὸς ὃν μεγαλήτορα θυμόν is
missod in Quintus The forms are 1, 99, μάλα τοῖα φίλῳ
προσελέξατο docui: 111, 56, Φοῖβος ἑὸν κατὰ θυμὸν ἔπος ποτὶ
τοῖον ἔειπεντ V, 464, λυγρὸν ἀνεστονάχησενε Χ, 423, αἰνὰ δ’
ἅναστενάχονσα φίλον προσελέξατο θνμόνε Χ, 471, καί τις ἑὸν
κατὰ θυμὸν ἔπος ποτὶ τοῖον ἔειπεν. The conception of the mono· “
logne in Homer² as a kind of dialogus in which the speaker half
personina his own thoughts as something distinct from him is not
so clearly in evidence in Quintus, as is seen in the forms of
introduction.

The Homeric monologues are distributcd largely among the
chief characters.³ This is not the case in Quintus Neoptolemus,
the hero of the epic, is not given a monologue. Zeus in the Iliad
has two, but none in the Posthomerica. Apollo alone of the gods
hasa monologue of three verses. The monologues in Quintus
have Homeric beginnings: 1, 100, ἆδειλήε ΙΠ, 57, ὢ πότοις
v, 465, ὤ μοι e’yd: Χ, 424,ὤ μοι. The monologues in Homer
concern themselves regularly with the speaker. In Quintus half
of them do, for the close of Andromache's monologue, 1, 100-14,
is personal. There is not a clear case in Quintus of the “Ent-
scheidungsmouolog.'’ The nearest approach to such are the

monologues of Aias, v, 465-81 and Oenone, Χ, 424-31. As
narrative substitutes for the Entscheidungsmonolcg may be
cited: 1, 601-10, ὅρμηνεν ἢ . . . . ἢ concluded by καὶτὰ μὲν ὣς
ὥρμαινε, 610; 1, too-133 v, {itt-9 concluded also by καὶ τὰ
