tunity for a speech by Athena in the guise of Ὀνειρος and its
repetition by Epeius to the Greeks in ΧΠ, 109-20, but both
opportunities are passed over. How Homer might have handled
the passage may perhaps be inferred from B 23-33 = 60-70.
There is not a case in Quintus where a command is given to a
messenger as such in oratio recta and delivered in oratio recta.
What might be regarded as instances of approximation to this are
the commands which occur in the speeohes of Odysseus in XII,
25-45, and of the shade of Achilles in XIV, 185-222. The
command in the former is not definitely directed, though later
fiilfilled by Sinon. Odysseus inserts in his speech the very
words in part which later are to be told to the Trojans when they
ask why the wooden horse was built, vv. 37-8: “ τὸν (ἵππον)
ἐκάμοντο l Παλλάδι χωομένῃ Τρώιον ὕπερ αἰχμητάων.” But
Quintus, reluctant to repeat‚¹ has Sinon say, ΧΠ, 377-8, δαΐφρονι
Τριτογενείῃ ἵππον ἐτεκτήναντο. The second speech to be con-
sidered is not one solely of command for the Achaeans, but in
the first part is one os advice to Neoptolemus.

In 111, 699 and xlv, 467 Hermes and Iris are sent as
messengers to Aeolus. There is no speech. In XIV, 478-9
we learn that Iris told Aeolus the command of Athena The
class of messenger speeohes is wanting in Quintus, and Iris
the messenger of Zeus, who speaks twelve times in the Iliad
does not speak in the Posthomerica. One misses there the
words of Zeus βάσκ’ ἴθι Ἰρι ταχεῖα that recur in the Iliad.²
Quintus has herein denied himself opportunities for introducing
commands repeated in substance such as Iris deliverS‚ which in·

to note in connection with 111, 699 where Hermes is the messenger
of Zeus that in the older epie poetry he was not yet a messenger
of the gods. He appears as messenger of Zeus in a 38, ε 29, while
Iris as messenger of the gods has completely disappeared from the

Odyssey.³ Iris speaks once in the Argonautica of Apollonius,
