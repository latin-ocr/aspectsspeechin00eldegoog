Aapwts of rte spect iotha luter Greek Ιθρίο. 45

Χ, 405, ὡς ὄφελόν μ’ ἕλεν Αἷσα, πάρος τάδε πήματ’ ἰδέσθαι.
x, 428, ὥς μ’ ὄφελόν ποτε Κῆρες ἀνηρείψαντο μέλαιναι,

In the group of speeches addressed to fallen fces the coin-
cidences are mostly in the προοίμια :

1, 644, κεῖσό ννν ἐν κονίῃσι κννῶν βόσις ἠδ’ οἰωνῶν
δειλαίη.
1, 757, κεῖσό νυν ἐν κονίῃσι λελασμένος ἀφροσυνάων.
V, 441 = Ι, 644.
VI, 385, κεῖσί νυν ἐν κονίῃσι
VI, 431, νῦν μὲνδὴ σύγε κεῖσο κατά χθονός.

The idea of coming against one's better also occurs in 1, 758 and
VI, 388. In the exhortations to fight Quintus shows a tendency
to a recurring initial form:

Ι, 409, ὦ φίλαι, ἄλκιμον ἦτορ ἐνὶ στέρνοισι βαλοῦσαι

VI, 604, d φίλοι, εί δ’ ἀῃε θυμὸν ε’νὶ στέρνοισι βαλόντες

VIII, 15, ιὲέκλυτέ μευ, θεράποντες, ἀρήιον έν φρεσὶ θυμόν
W&

Ix, 85, ὦ pilius, εἶδ’ ἀιγε θυμὸν ἀρήιον έν φρεσὶ θέσθε

The character cf the Argonautica is not favorable to these
congeneric speeches

Among the other speeches in Quintus that invite examination
is the tetralogy unique in epic poetry that is known as the ὅπλων
κρίσις, v, 181-316. Thetis, at the conclusion of the games in
honor of Achilles, calls upon the chieftain of the Achaeans that
saved the body of her son to come aud receive his armon (vv.
123-7). Odysseus and Telamonian Aias rise in response and
a forensis discussion is made possible. They both agree on
Idomeneus, Nestor and Agamemnon as judgeS, but on the advice
of Nestor these decline, and Trojan captives are assigned to
decide on the claims and merits of the two contestants. Quintus
has given both Aias and Odysseus two opportunities to speak.
Aias speaks first, and when he has stated his case in 56 verses
is followed by Odysseus in a speech of 52 verses. Then Aias
