suppression of the dialogus, for Basore, l. a, finds in Lucana
marked tendeney to restrict the elaborationes speech soenes:
“In only one instance does he group more than two speakers
and only twice exceeds the limite of simple address and reply.''
Apollonius is better off for dialogue. Besides the excellent illus-
tration to be cited from the opening of the third book which
adds so much to the life of the narrative are the conversations
between Chalciope and Medea, 111, 674-738, and Jason and
Medea, 111, 975-1145. ·

The speeehes eomprising dialogus in Greek epic are never
immediately consecutive. To this the narrative characteres epic
is opposed. Between the speeches is put at least a single verse.
Vergil has a bit of dialogus in which the speeches are not
separated, VI, 713-22.

Of that class of speeches which has been called “ Ohorrcden ''
Hentze¹ has gathered 28 examples from Homer, 10 from the Iliad,
18 from the Odyssey. They may be called collective speeches.
In the Iliad the speakers are generally the Greek and Trojan
warriors. The introductory formula is in the majority of cases
ὦδε δέ τις εἴπεσκεν frequently followed by ἰδὼν e‘r πλησίον ἄλλον.
The iterative form of the verb aoeompanied by ἄλλος or ras for
subject shows that the speech is conceived of as spoken by more
than one. The collective speeches in Apollonius are: 1, 242-63
251-93 1v, 1251-8, 1318-29. In 11, 145-533 1v, 1458-60
the subject is the indefinite τις, but without the iterative verbal
form which Apollonius does not employ in the collective speeches.
In lv, 1318-29 only, the subject is plural in form—cipimus.
The forms of introduction used are not in any case Homeric,
though those of conclusion in some instanoes differ only slightly.
These speeches express feeling and opinion rather than occasion
action.

Quintus has four collective speeches. In two XIV, 117-93
254-(5 the subject is plural. For 1, 212-9 a plurality of speakers
is affected by ἅμ’ ἀγρομένοισιν in the introductory verse. In 1,
ter-4 the iterative εἴπεσκεν gives the distributive effect. Tha
