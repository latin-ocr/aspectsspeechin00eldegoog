ψ 267-84. Hayman¹ remarks that it is very doubtful whether
Homer contains an instance of oratio obliqua carried consisteutly
through three subordinate clauses, thanks to a native buoyancy
cf style which speedily rectifies an oratio commenced as obliqua.

In Apollonius μίμησις is encroached upon by ἁπλῆ διήγησις,
though the materials for speech are not abundant. The best
opportunity is to be found in 111, 579-608 in the indirectly
recorded threat of Aeetes. In 1v, rao-5 words of threat are
concluded by ὣς ἔφατ’ Αἰήτης. The words of prophecy and
command uttered by the oahen beam in IV, 585-91 are not set
forth in the direct form, although it was αὐδῆεν, and the passage
is concluded by ὣς Ἀρηὼ ἰάχησεν. Α message, IV, rna-20,
clumsily given in oratio obliqua is also concluded by ds ἄρ’ ἔφη.
These passages differ from cases of oratio obliqua, recorded above
for Homer, in that they are not within speeches.

An examination of the Posthomerica shows that the materials
for speech are very slight. The best instance of oratio obliqua,
lx, 410-22, occurs in a passage descriptive of the embassy
of Odysseus and Diomedes to Philoctetes-a passage where
direct speech might have been employed effectively. As it
is, the whole embassy is unmarked by any speech. Quintus
seems to have been disinolined to elaborate a second embassy
scene. In the embassy of the same chieltains to Neoptolemus in
V11, roa-368 speech is employed. XI, 269-71-presents oppor-
tunity and material for prayer, of which there is a scanty amount
in the Posthomerica. Note also XII, aer-4 where oratio recta
might have been employed with good effect. These instances
also differ from the Homeric in not occurring within a speech.
But the material in both Apollonius and Quintus is meagre, and
had it been made over into oratio recta would not affect much the
percentage of speech for these authors.

Another source of decline in the amount of speech and the
number of speeches lies in the marked reluctance of the later epic
to repeat. An examination of Homer shows that repetition of a
speech completely as oratio recta is limited to a few instances, one
