12 Δορκάς osthc Speech iotha later Greek Epic.

The speakers in the different epic poems afford some interesting
and suggestive comparisons. The speeches in Homer are delivered
by either god or man with the single exception of the one by
Xan t,hus the horse of Achilles, to Achilles' m T 408 ff. where the
poet takes care to say (v. 407): αὐδήεντα δ’ ἔθηκε eea λευκώλενος
Ἥρη. One might also consider' ιιι this connection Π 15οι τοὺς
(Χάνθον καὶ Βαλί ον)” ετεκε Ζεφύρῳ ἀνέμῳ Αρπνια Ποδάργη. Το
the feeling of Oppian such a speech did not seem out of place.
Perhaps he had the speech of Xanthus in mind when he wrote
(Oynegetica, 1 226-8):

ἵππος ἐν ὑσμίνῃ ῥῆξεν ποτὲ δεσμά σιωπῆς,
καὶ φύσιος θεσμοὺς ὑπερέδραμε καὶ λάβεν ἠχήν
ἀνδρομέην καὶ γλῶσσαν ὁμοίϊον ἀνθρώποισιν.

The speeches by the rivers in Φ are no sooner mentioned than
disposed of. Personification (Φ 213, ἀνέρι εἱσάμενος) or deifica·
tion (Φ 223, Σκάμανδρε διοτρεφές) is a ready means. In the
Odyssey, r 546-50, there is a speech by an eagle recorded in
the direct form within the speech of Penelope, but the exception

is modified by vv. 548-9:

ἐγὼ δέ τοι αἰετὸς ὅρνις
ᾖα πάρος, νῦν αὖτε τεὸς πόσις εἰλήλουθα.

There is the further qualifying circumstance that Penelope heard
this speech in a dream. One may note here that Euphemus in
the Argonautica, IV, 1732 ffi, records hearing in a dream a speech
by a daughter of Triton who appeared from a lump of earth
(v.1736.

The spieeches in the Argonautica are spoken by divinities and
persons with the single exception of 111, 932-7, where a crow
speaks, The passage¹ is as follows (vv. 927-39):

Ἔστι δέ τις πεδίοιο κατὰ στίβον εὀργύθι νηοῦ
αἴγειρος φύλλοισιν ἀπειρεσίοις κομόωσα,
τῇ θαμά δὴ λακέρυζαι ἐπηυλίζοντο κορῶναι.

ῙΟι. Nonnus, 111, 97 fl.
