their words to each other. The three speeches collectively by
Nestor and Podalirius in the seventh book may be cited as an
instance of the extent for Quintus. The observation of Ηο111101
that Vergil does not allow the action 10 halt as Homer dces, and
the characters to engage in protracted discourse is applicable also
tn Quintus particularly in the eleventh book, but less so in the
eighth. In the battle that rages by the ships in the Iliad,
Idomeneus and Meriones meet and hold a dialogus, N 249-94,
which has nothing to do with the conclusiones 1110 battle. For
such dialogue Quintus has no parallel, with the result that the
eleventh book of the Posthomerica with its three paltry speeches,
amounting to 14 verses, is denied another² fruitful means of
mitigating the tedium of epic strife. Curiously enough, the
twenty-eighth book of Nonnus with the same amount of speech
suffers from 0 similarly unrelieved plethora of fight. In the
Posthomerica of the speeches addressed by Greeks to Trojans, or
Trojan allies and nice verso, the longest are those of Memnon and
Achilles, 11, 412-51, but they do not attain to the length of the
speeches of Achilles and Aeneas in Τ 177-258. So, too, in
the speeches of victors and vanquished Homer extends as in the
case of Achilles and Lycaon, Φ 74-113, 10 0 greater degree than
Quintus, Of. xm, 191-2023 226-40.

In the shrinkage of this element so important in epic‚ Quintus
is perhaps under the influenoe of Vergil, who also in comparison
with Homer show's a marked lack of dialogue.³ Heinze observes
that the dialogue in epic contributes only in 1010 1101011000 10 help
on the main theme, but serves rather 10 bring the characters
nearer the reader because their mutual relations are set forth or
developed before his eyes. The ὅπλων κρίσις presente 0 ,good
