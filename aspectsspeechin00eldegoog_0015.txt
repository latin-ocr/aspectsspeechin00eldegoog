contest of the bow, Ψ 850 ff, in mind when he wrote the descrip Ι
tion of a similar contest in IV, 405ffi The three other cases ol
exceptional beginnings arc slight affairs and occurring subsc-
quently to IV, los-9 may perhaps be regarded as reminiscences
of it: XII, 37-83 254-83 XIV, 602-4. Kvibala¹wrongly states,
therefore, that there is only a single instance in Quintus. He
happily observes that Homer would doubtless have extended the
introduction to a whole verse, comparing B 271, ὧδε δέ τις
εἴπεσκεν ἰδὼν ἐς πλησίον ἄλλον and H 178, ὧδε δέ τις εἴπεσκεν
ἰδὼν εἰς οὐρανὸν εὐρύν. It is certain at any rate that however
much Quintus may have been indebted to Vergil, he was not
affected by the Roman poet's habit of beginning and ending a
speech within a verse. According to Kvibala the Aeneid has 81
speeches which begin within a verse out of 336. A paltry colloc-
tion of four exceptions in 17 6. speeches in the Posthomerica
affords reasonable ground for believing that in this matter Quintus
was under the domination of Greek epic tradition subscribed to or
established by Homer and strictly observed by Apollonius of
Rhodes.

Several exceptions are to be found in the Dionysiaca of
Nonnus: Xv, 3893 xvi, 1453 XLII, 383 XIvIII, 279. In
XIII, 485 and XVI, 291 the speech ends within a verse, a practice
without the sanction of his predecessors for Iliad, B 70 and
O 82 do not offer exact parallels. Kvibala finds that 83 out of a
total of 336 speeches in the Aeneid end within a verse. The bits
of quoted discourse that occur within speeches in Nonnus offer in
addition a dozen instances of exceptional beginnings and endings.
But even in Nonnus the violations are trivial and some of these
may be accounted for. The exceptional beginnings in XV, 389,
405, 416 are doubtless to be explained by the fact that we have
here the license of the pastoral lament. The lament containing
XV, 405, 416 is unepic in character. It is comparable depart-
mentally with the Ἐπιτάφιος Ἀδώνιδος of Bion where the speech

of prris begins within the verse (42). The song of Daphnis
,in the first idyl of Theocritus has several such: 1-77, 82, 97, 100,
