which is thought to be contained in the word κορώνη (κορῶναι).
The hymn to Apollo with these allusions, recently written in the
time of Apollonius must heve been fresh in the minds of con·
temporary literary men interested in the works of the parties tc
the quarrel and have enabled them to feel the personality of
κορώνη; for they were already aware of the process by which
Callimachus had arrived at the word ibis as a name for his rival,
and after the recent emphasis by Callimachus of the connection
of Cyrene with the crow aud Apollo, they would also see hou
Apollonius in retaliation arrived at the name κορώνη for Calli·

(1) vv. lto-8 Φοῖβος καὶ βαθώγειον ἐμὴν πόλιν ἔφρασε Βάττῳ
καὶ Λιβύην ἐσιόντι κόραξ ήιγήσατο λαῷ
δεξιὸς οἰκιστὴρ, καὶ ὤμοσε τείχεα δώσειν
ἡμετέροις βασιλεῦσιν.

(2) vv. 72-3 Σπάρτη τοι, Καρνεῑε, τό γε πρώτιστον ἔδεθλον
δεύτερον αὖ Θήρη, τρίτατόν γε μὲν ἄστυ Κυρήνης.

(3) vv. 94-o οὐδὲ πολει τόσ’ ἔνειμεν ὀφέλσιμα, τόσσα Κυρήνη
μνωόμενος προτέρης ἁρπακτόος · οὐδὲ μὲν αὐτοὶ
Βαττιάδαι Φοίβοιο πλέον θεὸν ἄλλον ἔτισαν.

So κορώνη becomes a Callimachi civis and the following parallel
may be set down:

Naucratis Theuth ibis Apollonius
Cyrene Apollo crow Callimachus.¹

Whatever the origin of the name Κυρήνη may be, whether it
is really connected as Bechtel² thinks with κορωνίς, popular
etymology tempted by the tradition that a crow had a part in the
founding of Cyrene³ might readily have derived Κυρήνη from
